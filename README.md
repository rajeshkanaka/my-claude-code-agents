## Overview

This repository provides a modular framework for multi-agent orchestration, code intelligence, and production-grade review systems, designed for projects leveraging Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) conventions and scalable agent architectures. The system prioritizes maintainability, clarity, and compliance with best practices for advanced AI/ML agent development.

---

## Key Components

- **ADK-Agent Architect**
  - Ensures full compliance with Google ADK architectural standards
  - Implements orchestration logic, error handling, and integration with existing systems
  - Delivers production-ready, maintainable code without placeholders or mock implementations

- **Code Craftsman**
  - Focuses on clarity, defensive programming, and maintainability
  - Implements features and refactors code with rigorous quality checklists
  - Provides clear communication about implementation decisions and testing strategies

- **Code Guardian**
  - Performs systematic production readiness audits
  - Validates ADK compliance, performance optimizations, security, and error handling
  - Ensures robust testing and documentation for all agent modules

- **Codebase Strategist**
  - Conducts deep codebase analysis to map dependencies, data flows, and architectural patterns
  - Designs strategic implementation plans and risk mitigation strategies
  - Delivers actionable intelligence and recommendations for system improvements

---

## Operational Protocols

- **Project Analysis & Structure Mapping**
  - Deep scan of codebase
  - Detection of major entry points and integration mapping
  - Dependency tracing across modules

- **Multi-Level Documentation Creation**
  - Master file tree with annotated entry points
  - Sub-documentation for each agent module
  - Cross-referenced system for ecosystem navigation

- **Intelligence Integration**
  - Ensures contextual relevance, actionable content, and clear navigation at all documentation levels

- **Special Enhancements**
  - Entry point indexes, module interaction maps, quick start guides, pattern libraries, and performance playbooks

---

## Features

- Modular multi-agent orchestration for scalable intelligence workflows
- Production-grade code review and compliance checks
- File-structure-aware documentation for rapid onboarding
- Defensive programming and maintainability as core principles
- Integration-ready components with explicit instructions and configuration requirements

---

## Usage

1. **Getting Started**
   - Begin with `main.py` to understand the orchestrator flow.
   - Consult the root `Claude.md` for a project overview and navigation tips.
   - Reference sub-module documentation for agent-specific onboarding and patterns.

2. **Adding New Agents or Features**
   - Follow ADK compliance guidelines and codebase patterns.
   - Use the provided quality checklists and review protocols for implementation and deployment.

3. **Documentation**
   - Each module includes a Claude.md guide with entry points, integration notes, and performance tips.
   - Refer to “Quick Command Reference” and “Gotcha Warnings” for troubleshooting and optimization.
